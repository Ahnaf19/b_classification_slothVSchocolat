# b_classification_slothVSchocolat
This project showcases my journey into deep learning and CNNs, where I performed a binary classification task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset, sourced from Datacamp, contained images of sloths and pain au chocolat, split into training and validation folders.

## Key Highlights:

### From Scratch Approach:

- Built a CNN from scratch as I am new to deep learning.
- Fine-tuned the network's parameters, achieving 95% accuracy.
- Visualized the model's performance through loss and accuracy graphs.

### Transfer Learning:

- Leveraged the Datacamp community and PyTorch documentation to load and fine-tune a pretrained ResNet-18 model.
- Applied transfer learning, which resulted in an impressive 100% accuracy on the dataset.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of CNNs, deep learning, and transfer learning with PyTorch.
